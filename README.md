# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
Showcase Python skills and knowledge of Pandas by creating summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Also, we have been requested to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using Matplotlib. The end goal is to understand how the data differs by city type and offer PyBer insights that will guide their decision-making process. 

## Results

#### Urban city types lead in Total Rides, Total Drivers, and Total Fares. However, the Average Fare per Ride and per Driver is topped by Rural. This may be attributed to Rural's remote local and extended mileage. 

Additionally, the line chart below displays how the number of rides peak at the end of February across all city types.

## Summary
### In terms of recommendations...
1. Implement a surcharge in peak seasons (end of February) to increase revenue. 
2. Create more drivers in rural city types to generate more business and normalize the average fare per ride and driver compared to other city types.
3. Capitalize in the Suburban increase at the end of April by reallocating drivers as this is the only city type to increase in that time frame.
